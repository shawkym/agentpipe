# OpenRouter Solo Agent Example
#
# This example shows how to use a single OpenRouter agent for a conversation.
# This is useful for testing or when you want to use a specific model via API
# without installing its CLI tool.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable (or set api_key per agent)
#   - OpenRouter account with credits (https://openrouter.ai)
#
# Run with:
#   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
#   agentpipe run -c examples/openrouter-solo.yaml
